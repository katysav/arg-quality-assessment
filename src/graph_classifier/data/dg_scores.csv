0,arg167721,3,2,3,2,"It was undoubtedly Raffles' ambition and vision which led him to search for another British base in the Straits of Malacca, and to select Singapore as the best location to achieve British economic and strategic objectives in the region. Without Raffles, it is likely that Singapore would have remained a sparsely inhabited island, on the margins of the Dutch colonial empire in the East Indies."
1,arg168778,3,2,3,2,"FOUNDER IS NOT A PERSON WHO ""DISCOVERS"" A PLACE if so i can say the prince Sanila Utama is the founder of singapore!(this for some who say farquhar saw the island first) And I do know that farquer has been very involved in this help and sometimes even does all the work but let me remind you that being raffles ""assistant"" he still had to consult raffles and raffles had all authority over Singapore therefore he was given credit. Then i would like to ask u a question why then does the names ""raffles institution"" ""raffles hospital"" raffles medical clinics"""
2,arg168795,2,2,3,2,"Although Farquhar was said to be the one who stayed in Singapore to support its development, Raffles provided the planning, the strategizing, and was the one to select Singapore as another British base, giving early Singapore support of the British. If William Farquhar was to be proclaimed the founder because he did the ""grunt work"", shouldn't the supervisor of a construction site get the most commission, instead of the contractor? And besides, Raffles left Singapore under the orders of his superiors and he did not leave of free will"
3,arg168790,2,1,2,1,He revived the cultural heritage of the region by setting up schools for the Chinese and Malays and did a lot for the people while Farquhar just wanted to gain control through his actions.
4,arg168836,1,1,2,1,"Farquhar has a boss!(raffles) he has to follow raffles and not go about doing anything else if then why cant farquhar help singapore after he was fired? I say again you do need to be in a certain position to be a founder as time, money, effort is all invested. You must know people who would help you."
5,arg580842,1,1,2,1,"Raffles had a vision for Singapore that it will be an orderly, elegant, rational and modern and he worked towards it. And while Raffles was gone, Farquhar developed Singapore poorly causing Raffles to feel dissappointed."
6,arg168803,3,1,2,1,"Raffles conceived a town plan to remodel Singapore into a modern city. The plan consisted of separate areas for different ethnic groups and provision of other facilities such as roads, schools and lands for government buildings. In October 1822, a Town Plan Committee was formed by Raffles to oversee the project."
7,arg168824,3,3,3,3,"Raffles was the person who signed a treaty with the Temenggong and also the Sultan Hussien, and not William Farquhar. I agree that William Farquhar was the one that remained in Singapore to keep it running and also developed it further, but Raffles was the one who gave him the position because he had to leave and return to Bencoolen, also, he was the one who laid out the foundation of Singapore's Development, so he should be considered a founder."
8,arg168771,2,2,2,1,"The Singapore Treaty is signed between Raffles,Sultan Hussein and the Temenggong with Commandant under the accompanying seven ships witnessing the event."
9,arg168835,3,2,3,2,"Even though it is true that Raffles did not work closely with the population to develop Singapore, he provided plans, ideas and was going to put them in action by himself when his superiors ordered him to Bencoolen. Hence it was common sense for Raffles to leave his subordinate to finish his ideas"
10,arg168834,2,2,3,2,"Raffles doesn't care about the citizens, doesn't spare a thought at all.

So what if he discovered the island majulah singapura, he did not help in the least in singapore's development. so why in the world should he deserve the title of 'singapore's founder'?

Farquhar developed the island, with all his ideas contributing to the development."
11,arg168822,2,2,2,2,"Raffles neglected Singapore when he went around conquering other 'more useful' countries for about FOUR years, leaving all the work to Farquhar to settle. Plus, to drive my point further, the countries that were run by Raffles all ended up BADLY. This shows that Raffles was a bad developer of the country."
12,arg168780,2,2,2,2,"Faruhar carried out the 'grand plan' of Raffles'. Raffles practically just sat there and watched it all go, not even lifting a finger to help. It doesn't matter if Raffles was the head of the so-called operation, Farquhar was the one to DEVELOP Singapore to what it is today."
13,arg168804,2,1,2,1,"Faquhar solved the problems in Singapore using cash from his own pocket. When Singapore was once infested with rats and centipedes, Farquhar rewarded the people with coins for every pest they catch. This solved the problem quickly, as he held to his promise."
14,arg168774,3,2,3,2,"Farquhar was the one to implement the actual operations, whereas Raffles only came up with the ideas, which would or would not work. Actions require action, and Farquhar implemented those ideas."
15,arg168830,2,1,2,1,"Raffles came and left Singapore, returning after a long period of time. Farquar stayed here all the time, and solved many problems. Raffles did not do much at all compared to Farquar."
16,arg168807,2,1,2,1,William Farquhar had helped more citizen of Singapore than Raffles did. Raffles was just more of the idea man. William Farquhar was more of a founder of Singapore than Raffles.
17,arg168779,1,1,1,1,Farquhar was unjustly exiled by Raffles even though William had done a lot to help Singapore.
18,arg168818,2,1,2,1,"To me, a founder would be a leader, well respected by the organisation/group he is managing. Both Raffles and Farquhar were good leaders. However, when William Farquhar was sent off to Britain, more people went to send him off than the combined number of people that sent Raffles off during the three times Raffles left Singapore. This shows that the people of Singapore respected Farquhar more than Raffles, and to them, Farquhar was a more competent leader."
19,arg168801,2,1,2,1,"Farquhar contributed significantly, even forking out his own money to start up the colony carved out of the jungle, by first offering money as an incentive for people to hunt and to exterminate rats and centipedes. Raffles did nothing of that sort."
20,arg336563,1,1,2,1,"Yes because that way the child can learn not to do it again because it really hurt, and i know this from experience."
21,arg334884,1,1,2,1,"I believe so, it should be used as a last resort at least because I being a sibling of three, was spanked along with my sister and turned out to be disciplined and on the other hand our youngest sister has never been spanked and she tends to make more mistakes even now that shes 10 than we did."
22,arg335047,1,1,2,1,"Parents should use spanking as an option to discipline only when it's needed. If the child doesn't follow the correct behavior that they should follow after several times being warned, then that is when the child deserves a spanking."
23,arg336222,1,1,2,1,"Humans have been raised for thousands of years with not near as much resentment towards spanking and today's kids are the unruliest there are...

There's a trend...

(I do admit it's not purely spanking that's the cause but it's a small part of the bigger picture)"
24,arg335090,1,1,2,1,Yes I believe you should spank a child only when they know they are wrong. The child will understand more if he is scared to do the same mistake. Actions speak louder than words.
25,arg335089,1,1,2,1,yes because if they fear getting hit than they wont do it again
26,arg334924,1,1,2,1,"because depending on the punishment you give a child it doesn't always work, some kids need need that. because just sitting them in punishment its a possibility they will do it again."
27,arg334959,2,2,3,1,"yea, because even though there are many other different ways to discipline kids, sometimes it won't work so they need a little spank, just to make them learn they were wrong. don't always be spanking them for no reason, that's bad"
28,arg334973,1,1,2,1,"Yes, parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their children, but it should be the last option."
29,arg335097,1,1,2,1,"In my opinion, I strongly agree that parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their children because the spankings are painful enough for children to learn to avoid doing the wrong things."
30,arg335095,2,2,2,2,"Spanking should not be an option to discipline a child, parents have a lot other options before spanking. Its better to talk to them about what they did wrong and solve the problem in a proper way."
31,arg336204,2,2,3,2,"I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment like spanking to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them."
32,arg335564,3,3,3,2,"Nope. I believe it shouldnt be done just to discipline a child. Parents could just scold their child just so they would stop what they are doing wrong. Hitting is not really a solution because aside hurting a child emotionally, it also hurts them physically. Kids wouldnt learn the value of respect for their parents because they would only learn how to be scared. They wont do the wrong action again next time, not because they've learned their lesson, but because they are just scared that their parents would hit them"
33,arg335129,2,1,2,1,"I don't think anybody would have liked to get spanked by there parents therefore , spanking shouldn't be an Option"
34,arg334934,2,2,3,2,"A parent shouldn't use spanking as an option to discipline a child because they might grow up traumatized and they might feel unloved since they would get spanked a lot, that will cause a low self of esteem. Also spanking shouldn't be an option because at that moment the parent would be full with anger and they wouldn't be thinking logically."
35,arg335091,2,2,2,2,Parents shouldn't use spanking as an option to discipline it just makes the child get mad than to see what they did wrong.
36,arg336179,2,2,2,1,No because hitting your child could mentally scar them for life. also it can make them think hitting their kids is alright.
37,arg334943,2,1,2,1,"No because spanking might effects the relationship between the child and parents. And Children can pick up on the parents attitude acting violent. There are better ways to solve problems, for example using the other techniques."
38,arg334968,2,2,2,2,Physical abuse towards children causes them to fear their parents and may cause a stutter.
39,arg335030,2,1,2,1,"Some kids don't learn by spanking them..So why waste your time on that, when you can always take something valuable away from them."
40,13279,1,1,2,1,"In Nebraska, it's legal to have an abortion by killing the baby while it's coming out of the womb. How can you argue against that?"
41,13275,2,1,2,1,"""The government has no place to tell a woman what she can do with her own body, ever.""

The government DOES have that right.

1) a woman cannot legally prostitute herself in many states

2) a woman cannot take illicit drugs into her own body

3) a woman cannot use her body to murder others

4) a woman cannot use her body to steal

5) a woman cannot display her naked body in public

there are many others. Men can also not do these things.

The government tells us what to do with our bodies ALL THE TIME. This is no different."
42,30319,2,1,2,1,Statistics prove that less than 1% of women who are raped get pregnant because of the adrenalin rush. We have no right to take an unborn child's life. There are ways to avoid the situation of abortion. The woman can have the baby and give it up for adoption or raise it as their own because the woman is the still the child's biological mother. There are thousands of people on the waiting list for another baby to add to their family. DO NOT let anyone tell you otherwise because they obviously havn't been in the situation of adoption or abortion.
43,76937,2,1,2,1,I choose life. Keeping the law pro-choice is allowing women to murder their own unborn human child.
44,75146,2,1,2,1,what we are dealing with is indirect murder if a women decides to abort a child she just had killed a life that may have been a big contribution to society
45,13259,2,1,2,1,"Nobody has the right to tell you what to do with your body, but if that which you are trying to rid off moves away at the first sign of pain, without you feeling it, then ""that"" is no longer yours, since it feels outside your own."
46,70668,2,2,2,2,"There is only one situation in which I believe abortion is okay.

If a mother is incapable of giving birth to the child, and attempting it might kill her, I believe abortion is sad, but necessary.

Otherwise, no one has the right to kill a child, born or unborn."
47,13260,2,2,3,2,"There are tons of ways to not get pregnant. There are condoms (99% effective) for men and women, there are morning-after pills (75% effective), the patch, pill, and other forms of ways not to get pregnant. It's the woman's fault that she didn't do it.

And maybe instead of Pro-choice vs. Pro-life, they (i don't know who ""they"" is) should have pro-life, but with exceptions (i.e. women that get raped) so that it's fair all-around."
48,13270,1,2,2,1,"""If a women is raped"" is a good argument. However why would you punish an innocent baby with the death penalty for some other man's crime. If the women does not want the child she could give it up for adoption. I just dont understand why you would kill the baby, the emotional trauma would happen without the baby as well."
49,54474,2,1,3,2,"A growing embryo is considered human with the heartbeats initiating as early as 21st day of conception. So what if we cannot see the human form, it does have the potential to gain one.

Around 60% of abortions are performed on never married women. Why can't women give the baby up for adoption instead, even if she is raped. If your raped does that give you the right to got out and kill someone?"
50,63512,2,2,3,2,"Here's a story for you from a few years back. A nine year old girl living in poverty in South America was raped by her step dad, and got pregnant with twins. Her family knew that she would die in childbirth, but she was not allowed to get an abortion because they were devout catholics. Both her and her two children died. That's three lives lost. One of those lives actually knew what life was."
51,1661,2,1,2,1,While I personally do not think that abortion is right in any way shape or form. I do not believe the government has the right to make that decision. This is a decision to be made by the parents of the unborn child. NOT the government.
52,74039,2,1,2,1,"You don't know these girl's/women's stories, who are you to judge what they can or can't do? Until you've walked a mile in these girl's/women's shoes, than you may have the opportunity to speak on their behalf. Until then, you may not have to like it and may stand firm with your opinion, but at least have the audacity to respect other's opinions on the subject matter."
53,28415,3,2,3,2,"Giving up a child has to be one of the most responsible decisions a woman can make in her life. Have you any idea the responsibility and maturity it takes to make such an important decision?

If a woman can not support a child(Either emotionally, physically, or financially) she should have right to choose to give up that child."
54,1683,1,1,2,1,"In the United States of America, pro-choice is the only constitutional way to go. Elsewhere in the world, people will do whatever they want."
55,37929,2,2,3,2,"Im going to take the Obama approach to this

Abortion is never something a women would take lightly there will always be a lot of thinking asking for help and even praying involved with making that decision. The pro-life people just don't seam to understand that we also think the abortion is a sad and awful thing and we pro-choicers hope nobody would ever have to make this difficult and life altering situation. there for this decision should be left to the women and not some man miles away in d.c. that has never faced it"
56,1633,2,1,3,1,"If a woman is raped and left with the bastard child of the man who raped her and severely emotionally traumatized her, she should have the decision to give up that baby. Certain circumstances call for desperate decisions and this is one, the choice should be her's to make and she should be allowed to make it."
57,28498,1,1,2,1,"The only other choices are, adoption or keep it.

And I know many children get adopted but many don't

and it might be better off to just have an abortion to

let them suffer.

That's the chance they take, I guess. But who are we to

decide one womans pregnancy."
58,1641,2,2,3,2,"Surely if we are worried about the feelings of unborn children within the first few months of pregnancy, than we should first be worried about protecting the rights of far more conscious animals, such as fully-developed primates.

If its isn't their feelings we are worried about, then I guess I am very confused about the pro-life point of view."
59,69016,2,1,2,1,Who are we to judge what is right or wrong? Can we not just let people make decisions and live with the consequences?
60,arg126375,2,2,3,2,"well, India is finding difficult to manage itself first...so there's no question of leading the world so far....but still if we compare so lets have a look at the following points:

1. almost 90% of India is illiterate(don't be sure of the percentage), so an illiterate country can't lead the world....

2.India is more into castes, politics, religions and less into development.

3.the most important thing is that India doesn't have confidence on itself and is still cursing itself...

So if it goes on so then it is difficult or even impossible to say that ""INDIA WILL LEAD THE WORLD WHEN IT CANNOT LEAD ITSELF!!"""
61,arg145468,2,2,2,2,"All we can say is a big IF because we are not yet 100% sure if this nation itself could lead the whole world. Who knows maybe in the future that India could fail to lead us. There are still other countries who are more progressive, more literated, more powerful than India, like the USA, United Kingdom, Russia, Japan, etc. This nation doesn't have yet enought potentials and ability to sustain the needs of the people. India is not yet that full of technologies like in the Americas. Well in fact technology is one of the most sophisticated and essential inventions ever created."
62,arg122478,2,1,2,1,"i think, the india is not ready to lead the world because of many reasons..

1.) the politians of our country are involved in black money cases. they try to gain or earn money as possible.

2.) they always try to make a big issue of useless topics. e.g., if a politian says something about another politian, they try to make it a big issue ."

The India growth story is indeed enviable. Despite being plagued by myriad problems, India has emerged stronger and more resilient to any global crises so far.

80,80854,3,2,3,2,"Science can prove that evolution is the beginning of life.

The big bang theory is a term used to describe the bursting of molecules that begun the creation of the universe. The universe started out as a hot, dense space. Scientists know that because now nearby galaxies are moving further and further away and the universe is expanding and becoming cooler, so, in the past, the universe must have been hotter and more dense. Earth was the perfect candidate for life because it has the ""Goldilocks"" conditions.

VIRUS studies

Ohh yeah, viruses.

Do you know how strains of viruses become immune to anti biotic? They evolve, and because viruses reproduce very quickly they evolve over a shorter time period and can be observed by humans.

Who says that God did it himself?

Who says that God didn't cause the Big Bang or evolution to occur?

FINAL ANSWER: EVOLUTION THROUGH CREATION"
86,794,3,3,3,2,"You can actually see evolution happen. Fruit Flies are quite useful for this experiment since the breed, live, and die so quickly. You have to understand evolution happens because of mutations and they survive because those mutations have made it easier for the creature to survive then the others. ie. natural selection. Speciation is also an example of evolution... different species come about because they have adapted to a slightly different enviroment. If you look you can see evolution"
87,814,2,2,2,2,Evolution is a science. All the refutes I have seen (which I will rebuttal after this) have nothing to do with science. Their claims are theological claims. Lets first know what science is. Science is known through the scientific method. The scientific method deals only with the natural world.

what insects are you talking about?"
89,70855,2,2,3,2,"There has to have been a creator. If you believe in 'The Big Bang', then that's fine. But what caused it? And if it was caused by certain gases reacting with each other, then where did those gases come from? It doesn't matter how you think this universe came to be. The point is that it can't have just appeared. There must have been a creator."
90,12589,2,2,2,1,"That doesn't make much sense. Why are we still evolving and the monkeys aren't?

Why aren't fish jumping out of the water and growing legs?

I mean, if it happened billions of years ago than how come its not happening today?

Why can't we find psuedo-hybrid fish with legs forming?

What caused evolution to stop happening for a mysterious time of thousands of years?"
91,28068,2,1,2,1,"""Debates are based on convincing evidence. There is very little evidence supporting creation, while there are massive amounts supporting an evolutionary argument.""

True. But, evidence must withstand the test of accepted truth. We can't say that creation is false, because there is no explanation provided for the origins of the ""particles"" that caused the evolution theory. Although the evolution theory is interesting, and quite possible, it does not rule out creation. Since creation cannot be ruled out in any way, and evolution can, creation is the best possible theory."
92,71559,2,2,3,2,"I am a nurse and the more I studied biology, the more I was in awe of the miracle of our bodies. Every tiny cell has it's own design that is even more complex than a computer. When you look at a computer do you question that there had to be a creator? Or do you need proof that this highly organized machine came to be about by a mere accident or order of circumstances? Evolutionists need more faith than Creationists."
93,12567,2,2,3,1,"The scientific rigor you mention is not present in evolutionary theory. Here's one example: In the 1800s, Charles Lyell and others came up with dates for the rock strata. Radiometric dating wasn't invented until the 1900s. When it was invented, the techniques were calibrated to match the dates Lyell came up with. To say that this proves the dates that Lyell came up with is a logical fallacy, and it sure doesn't sound like true scientific rigor to me."
94,12592,1,1,2,1,I can prove to you that humans have not evolved since the beginning of recorded history
95,arg33141,1,1,2,1,"I believe its best advancing towards the common good, but it doesn't really exist in this world. Mostly everyone is greedy, selfish, only would care about what they want, and not caring about what others would want. I believe everyone have small feeling towards the common good, but most people think they are important than anyone else in the whole world."
96,arg33099,2,1,2,1,"advancing the common good is better to me because, If i were to pursue my own personal pursuit, it wouldn't be all that good, because most of them would be selfish choices that woulld end up hurting someone else, i dont like hurting people. It would be a much better world if we thought about everyone else well being before we think about our selves."
97,arg33135,2,2,2,2,I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.
98,arg33129,2,2,3,2,"I volunteer at Irving Cares, and when I do I feel so great that I can help the community. To me when I help advance the common good I am helping myself. When people do something for the good of others it helps them out in the long run. Whether it is a favor in return or anything else. In a personal pursuit you are just helping yourself. If we all just helped ourselves where would our world be? We all depend on others for help at some point. This world should be about others, not just me."
99,arg33162,3,3,3,3,"This is planet Earth, shared by billions, not just you. If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear ""it's human nature to be selfish"" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space."
100,arg33060,2,1,2,1,I think that advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit. The reason for this is that it is better to help others than just to think about yourself. We need to improve our community first before we think about ourselves. If everyone tried to take care of their community then there would be no dangerous places.
101,arg33082,2,1,2,1,"Both endeavors are better to be part of.But I as an individual I would like to advance the common good in this society to become unpetty with each other,to do things way better than they use to.Everyone in this world knows what they want to be. To be alone pursuing their dreams without the help of others, but some other will help the community to make it safe and better.To teach them what they are capable of,to beleive in themselfs that they can do as the things wealthy people does."
102,arg33119,2,1,2,1,"I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself."
103,arg33089,2,1,2,1,"The ability to do both would be awesome, but since I have to choose I'd rather help others in any way I can. Even a little thing can impact someone's life, like being a friend or helping them with getting their needs to survive life."
104,arg33075,3,2,3,2,"While striving to make advancements for the common good you can change the world forever.

Allot of people have succeded in doing so. Our founding fathers, Thomas Edison, George Washington, Martin Luther King jr, and many more. These people made huge advances for the common good and they are honored for it."
105,arg33070,2,2,3,2,I believe it is more important to have personal pursuit because if you even want to begin to help others you have to help yourself. It's not bad to want to help the common good but if you're always putting other people before yourself you may start to forget about your own needs and wants in life. But I do think that you can have a balance of both.
106,arg33127,2,2,3,2,I think that personal pursuit is more important because in order to help others you have to help yourself first. At the time it may seem selfish but once that you get to a point that you are good at what your doing then you can help others do the same. So not only are you helping yourself but you are also helping others.
107,arg33115,2,2,3,1,"I think i will go with personal persuit because no matter what we do we think of ourself first. I think its the human nature.But personal pursuit does not mean being selfish and only caring about oneself.I need to think about me first,success and then think of others. Everyone does think of themselves before thinking about others. First i need to make me happy to make others happy. This way i can make my life better and be who i am."
108,arg33118,2,1,1,1,"I believe personal pursuit its better, because its your job to decide what you want to do with your life. Your not always going to have someone by your side telling you whats right or wrong. Its all on you of reaching their goals. Its also a good thing to help other reach their succeed their goals."
109,arg33143,1,1,2,1,"I feel that a personal pursuit is a better endeavor. Your personal pursuit should come first before anyone else's. But then again I really don't know, because if someone in your family is in need of something then you're going to do anything help that family member out. I believe that helping someone in your family is just something you do no matter what because they're blood. If someone who you don't know is in need at the same time as someone who is related to you, you're going to help the family member out instead of the random person you don't know."
110,arg33086,2,2,2,2,"A personal pursuit is a better endeavor because you are fulfilling something within yourself. It is important to help others but there is a time to do so. Achieving a personal goal is a journey to fulfillment where one is truly happy. Before helping others you must remember about yourself, but you must not forget about those who are really in need."
111,arg33069,1,1,2,1,"Human nature is to endeavor personal pursuit. If you assume that human nature is to endeavor advancing the common good, then you're going to get screwed by someone who endeavors personal pursuit. Most Americans endeavor advancing the common good; which is why they get screwed by politicians who endeavor personal pursuit. If everyone endeavors personal pursuit, then we would keep each other in check. It is easier to get most people to endeavor personal pursuit than it is to get most people to endeavor advancing the common good; which is why communism failed."
112,arg33126,2,2,2,2,Helping others for the common good can give you a feeling of pride but you have to have the means to be able to help the other person. To have those means you first have to have personal pursuit. I don't think one is better than the other but you first have to have personal pursuit before you can have common good. However for some people their personal pursuit can be the advancement of the common good.
113,arg33105,2,2,2,2,"it is better to help yourself before you can help others. for instance, if you don't have your life together how are you going to help someone else with theirs. if your still living at home with your mother and you don't have a job and one want to help out by giving to an organization you couldn't do it. so basically you have to help yourself before you can help others."
114,arg33123,2,2,2,2,"In order to help advance a common good, you must first realize what is your common good. You have to know when you are that better person to then spread your good to other people. You can't just assume that you are a great person if you don't have anything to show it. If you desire to see a world full of all this goodness, YOU have to be that spark that starts the fire."
115,390,3,3,3,2,"firefox is much better.

It remembers passwords with greater gusto.

add-ons allow you to personalize your browser in every way. I love - tabs (aging and remembering them when you close the browser, weatherfox, gestures,

there is even a tab that lets you display the page in IE format if something is incompatible (rare, only SAP at work)

and the way you can put the link logos in the tool bar rocks.

much friendlier and a better browser, and not just because i don't want to support MS. Because i don't care about that, a good product is a good product."
116,458,2,2,3,2,Mozilla Firefox can be used for everything! There are also plugins so that you can use the internet explorer engine in the firefox shell. It has many more plugins and the themes are a nice feature. all of the innovations in E 7.0 were in firefox years ago.
117,460,2,2,3,2,Firefox takes the best of all previous browsers and sticks it all in one neat package. Security and extendibility are some of its top features. And those times when FF seems to eat up a lot of memory? That's just the cache so you're able to surf the net even faster. Just lower the cache if you don't want to eat so much memory.
118,477,2,2,2,2,"From a design standpoint, Firefox absolutely wins the Pretty Browser battle.

There is such an array of beautiful skins out there for Firefox, and when you add that to the amount of Toolbar and UI customization that Firefox supports, the 'Fox is the clear-cut winner.

And since I assume most of the people debating the superiority of one browser or another are Intraweb junkies, I know everyone uses their browser quite often.

Who wants to look at an ugly UI like that of every IE (7 is the most criminal of them all)?"
119,468,2,2,3,1,Firefox has the user made extensions which cater for the user based community therefore it wins
120,415,1,1,1,1,Really great arguments why IE is supposed to be a better browser... NOT!
121,389,2,1,2,1,Firefox is more respectful of W3C internet standards while  soft sucks by trying to force us to use their own standards to keep their monopoly.
122,76359,1,1,1,1,Firefox of course. And I like this website but I don't find it very clear. This one is better : theworlddebating.com
123,33757,2,2,3,2,"There's no reason at all why anyone could say IE is better. Firefox is proven to be safer, faster, and sleeker. You can customize it to look any way you want, and you can add any functionality you can think of. It even has a more original name!"
124,405,3,2,3,2,"I find that whatever works for a person individually, is good. How would I be able to say something is the best, when, it doesn't work on someone elses computer? I vote for Firefox, because in my experience it has worked multiple times better than Internet Explorer. The config isn't too bad, and those of you who know about:config know what I'm talking about. The tabs are great, and has many good extensions. Though not the best, it is definately superior to Internet Explorer. Especially after the laughable 7 update. ;D"
125,33187,2,1,2,1,"Coming from a casual internet user, I prefer IE because it has a sleeker design, and I find the bookmark/history thing easier. I'm using firefox though, cuz I don't want to transfer my bookmarks again after my brother made it my default browser."
126,12371,2,1,3,1,"I was a IE user from the beginning, but recently I started using Firefox. Apart from the obvious differences like availability of tabs in Firefox which was not avaible in IE I don't find any other significant advantages in using firefox. Also now IE7 has got the tabs feature included, along with add-ons to provide different functionalities.

So I think IE is better than firefox."
127,12367,2,1,3,1,"Firefox (and the extensions) leaks memory like a sieve. An opened session of Firefox 2.0.0.1, three tabs, one week, uses 250  Meg of memory under Task Manager on Windows."
128,65191,1,1,1,1,Well personally I believe Google Chrome is the S*** but Firefox crashes every time I use it.
129,12365,2,1,3,1,"(I am writing this through Firefox) Emotions aside, Firefox has no ActiveX support. It makes it unusable for at least the new wonder tool, Windows VirtualEarth."
130,12388,3,2,3,2,"IE7 on Vista supports protected mode which runs the browser in a security context that has minimal access to your computer and private information. Both Firefox and IE are internet facing apps with occasional security issues, so I prefer the browser with better security architecture."
131,12383,2,2,3,1,I used to be a firefox user but I only have 2GBs of RAM on my system and I like to use more than one program at a time. Firefox sucks up way too much memory to justify the one or two advantages.
132,12380,2,2,3,2,"I'm not an IE user but FFX has a lot of issues

First, it does not start fast when it is loaded from the disk. For my 3 yr old computer, it takes about 10 or more seconds to start it, unlike the browser I use Opera it takes much less time to start.

Plug-ins i frequently use such as Adobe Flash Player does not perfrom well in FFX. The flash movie often stops in FX unlike in Opera which plays flash movies smoothly.

Lastly, Firefox is still young. I guess it is much better than IE. But for me Opera is still the best."

Man/woman relationships, especially in the aggregate, have a very different set of implications than man/man and woman/woman relationships.

138,31527,2,1,2,1,"The Marriage issue should be out of politicians and lawmakers. Marriages are for the Church to decide, Congress have no power to pass a legislation forcing religious institutions about marriage. Maybe, if the courts were to allow gay marriage, it would be alright since it is not a religious institution, it doesn't break the Separation between Church and State ruled by the Supreme Court."
139,42624,1,1,2,1,"An action is ethical if society as a whole would benefit if we all did it. Fair enough?

If everyone had a gay marriage, then society as a whole would NOT benefit. In fact, we would all become extinct, because without one man and one woman there would be no reproduction and continuation of our species.

Therefore, gay marriage can't be ethical.

You can't refute my statement by saying, ""There will always be straight people"" because that's like saying killing someone is right because there will always be those who won't kill."
140,12421,2,1,2,1,"The real issue is - why is the government involved in this issue at all? We take a personal, religious institution and regulate it, then the government comes back and wants to redefine it.

It should not be a political issue, because my personal, religious things should be separate from government regulation.

Marriage and the government should not mix. That solves the ""problem""."
141,12402,2,2,2,1,"From a religious standpoint gay marriage isn't even possible. Let along right. But everyone isn't religious or adheres to specific religious guidance.

Marriage is defined as between a woman and a man. So the word ""marriage"" may be misused in this case. Civil unions, well that's a different matter."
142,76796,2,1,2,1,"Why don't we just get rid of any incentive to be married, politically that is. No tax deductions, no married filing jointly; nothing. Let the churches perform marriages, get the government out completely. If a particular denomination wants to condone homosexuality let them, it's them that are going against their religion.

I don't support it. Like I said, if there were not tax breaks or incentives to be married in the eyes of the state, who cares. My church doesn't support it. It irks me that people who claim to Christians support it and even allow homosexual clergy."

175,arg33280,2,2,3,2,"Yes, if the person I loved and lived with murdered someone then I would definitely turn them in. Murder is premeditated and intentional so you never know if later on down the line they will turn on you."
176,arg33293,2,1,2,1,i would turn in my wife because its wrong to kill someone. it could have been an accident but it was still wrong and besides the police are going to find out who killed that person but i don't want her to leave me for a long period of time so i would tell but then again i wouldn't.
177,arg33342,2,2,3,2,"I would have to say yes. She committed murder, a thing that can get you in major trouble, even if you're an accompalice. I don't care what the reason was, it could have been accidental, there could have been someone trying to attack her, or whatever, she killed someone. The second she tells me, I wil call the police, just in case she either goes on another killing spree or decides to kill me"
178,arg33339,2,2,3,2,"Yes I would be happy and relieved to turn my spouse in for murder. Killing someone is the one number one crime in this world. I don't want to stay married to a crazy woman who commits murder. I wouldn't feel safe if we have children in the house or sleeping next to her. I wouldn't be able to sleep or think right for months, maybe years."
179,arg33289,2,2,3,2,"Yes definately i will turn him in to the police because he has commited a murder and its a sin. Maybe if he gets arrested,he can feel guilty for what he has done and try not to repeat it again. And also how can i trust a murderer?He can even be telling a lie to me and maybe can kill me for someone else in the future.so Just by confiding to me does not make him clean and innocent."
180,arg33272,2,2,3,2,"If my spouse committed murder I would have to turn them in, because I don't think I could go on with life knowing that they've murdered someone. The relationship wouldn't be the same it would change because now you view the person as somebody else, you don't see them as your spouse any more, you just see them as a bad person, and they could be crazy enough to do something to you."
181,arg33261,3,3,3,3,"As an ambitious, young person wanting to become a lawful, successful, homicide detective, I would not be lenient with any murderer in my midst.

Hopefully, the murder wouldn't be the result of a pleasure/malicious-kill, so that the sentencing won't be as harsh, but nonetheless, all murderers must be tried. After all, hopefully my spouse will understand that having to live in hiding is basically the same as being in prison except much worse since there would be little chance for parole since they will have to live with the guilt and/or the fear of being caught for the rest of their lives."
182,arg33323,3,3,3,2,"Murder under any circumstance is not right. A person who commits the act knows the consequences, and they know that they are guilty. I wouldn't be able to look at my spouse the same ever again. I would not be able to live with the secret of a murder.

So yea, i would turn them in."
183,arg33298,2,2,3,2,"If it was the person you truly love and want to spend the rest of your life with then it's a definitely no. People make mistakes but although it's a major crime to murder someone I would still not turn in the person I love the most. If I plan on staying with that person I love for the rest of my life then I would stick with them and never turn them in. And if that means that I am part of that murder by not saying anything, well then so be it."
184,arg33288,2,2,2,2,"As human beings, we are selfish and have been fabricated with a survival mechanism that tell is to do whatever whenever to protect the ones that we love. I would do everything in my power to protect my love, even if that means taking this horrible secret to the grave."
185,arg33319,2,2,3,2,"I really don't know because i think it depends on who she murdered and how it happened. If it was self defense then no I wouldn't tell the police, but if she just went crazy and murdered someone then yes i would tell the police."
186,arg33226,2,1,2,1,I wouldnt turn her in becuase she is my wife. She made a mistake that we can get over it. If she trusted me by telling me what she did then I couldn't do that to her.
187,arg33233,2,2,2,2,If my wife confided in me than I wouldn't betray her trust. She trusted me to support and help her and I would. I would be extremely angry and maybe even divorce her depending on what type of murder whether it be like a self defence murder or she just thought it would be fun.
188,arg33270,2,2,3,2,No. I couldn't imagine turning on my spouse like that. I know if i were to do something like that she will be right there next to me not saying a word. Plus if she were to kill someone it would be for a good reason.
189,arg33285,1,1,2,1,No I wouldn't turn in my spouse. Just because the girl that i married killed someone doesn't make them a terrible person. People make mistakes.
190,arg33341,1,1,2,1,"If my spouse committed murder I would not turn him in. I would do the exact opposite I will help him hide all evidence if any, I will move if we had to, and I will never bring it up to his attention again. If my husband killed someone, he knew what he was doing, so there or it was for a cost. It would be hard for me to turn in the one I love."
191,arg33243,2,1,2,1,No I wouldn't tell on him because you never know what the reason might be for him to kill that person or it could have been for self defense for all we know and if the people come question me about anything I DON'T KNOW NOTHING.....he have my trust and I wouldn't let him down for no reason plus his secret is safe with me...
192,arg33279,3,2,3,2,"It really depends on what had happened, she would have to tell me the story and I would have to be able to sympathize with her and understand why she did what she did. If I truly felt that she was remorseful for what she did and I can sympathize with her about why she committed murder than maybe I could forgive her and not turn her in."
193,arg260899,2,2,2,2,"Yes. Physical education, if taught and encouraged properly and approached with the right attitude, will be rewarding for both student and teacher."
194,arg37974,1,1,1,1,"Kids are fat these days.. p.e. helps!!1!!!!!one!!!!

and itll help them relize heath is important for there lame ass futures lol"
195,arg54258,3,3,3,3,"PE should be compulsory because it keeps us constantly fit and healthy. If you really dislike sports, then you can quit it when you're an adult. But when you're a kid, the best thing for you to do is study, play and exercise. If you prefer to be lazy and lie on the couch all day then you are most likely to get sick and unfit. Besides, PE helps kids be better at teamwork."
196,arg345997,2,2,2,2,"I feel like Physical education should be mandatory because people need there exercise. If they don't get physical activity they wont burn as much fats as they accumulate thus will get chubbier. They should be stricter during those classes of Physical education because a lot of the time people mostly just stand around. I don't want to seem sexist, but the ones that get the least exercise are the girls and they just mostly stand there and socialize. They need a way to keep everyone active, people need to get moving! They need this for there health!"
197,arg107445,2,1,2,1,i think that PE clases should be obligatory in school to help the problem of obecity.
198,arg7751,3,2,3,2,"It should be mandatory because being active and getting involved in sports, even through PE, helps children develop good habits later on in life. Plus, there's the benefit of working together as a team that doesn't always happen in other classes."
199,arg107456,3,3,3,3,"Most people think that PE classes are completely useless because the only thing you would normally do in a PE class is run around. But there is more to a PE class then just running around the field for an hour. With physical education you can get muscles, you can become stronger, it wouldn't be so easily for you to become fat (of course you would also need to keep a balanced diet) and for further ages (like 60-80) it would prevent you from having heart attacks. With the help of this class there would be fewer obese children around the globe and more fit and strong people."
200,arg148559,2,2,2,1,I think it is great idea to make physical education be mandatory in school because it will be healthy for the student to become a healthy person and they will not have the risk of obesity.
201,arg213068,2,1,2,1,How are we supposed to curb childhood obesity if we don't start at a young age?
202,arg230691,2,2,2,2,"schools should have PE because the school i attend only has pe for middle school not high school we are a middle and a high school combined. because the lack of physical education in our high school many students are out of shape and have developed many bad non active habits and as our first year in sports our sports athletes have shown how hard it is to perform simple pre season conditioning and they quote ""if we had PE conditions would be easier and would have made conditioning simple"" the lack of exercise had caused them to only accomplish only 3 push-ups!"
203,arg216634,1,1,1,1,P.E doesn't help fat kids the fat kids just eat too much or they are growing and eventually they will be normal.
204,arg312577,2,1,2,1,"P.E. should be optional in 8th grade. If students want to participate, then so be it. However, in 8th grade students have a lot going on. That time may be used more beneficially by studying."
205,arg54267,2,2,2,1,"Physical education does absolutely nothing for the children's health and/or lifestyle. Let me describe my PE experience.

Throughout my public education career, PE has been mandatory for each year. This has involved barely moving, standing talking with friends, half-hearted volleyball/dodgeball, yearly physical fitness tests that don't require effort, DDR, bouncing on fitness balls, and, most recently at my arts high school, watching sports documentaries and playing Wii Sports.

Unless public education is reformed, health classes can teach children what they need to know about fitness and nutrition, because PE classes are severely lacking."
206,arg485419,1,1,2,1,"Sport should not be compulsaryy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So man kids get bullied in pe because they are fatter then others or more unfit! Bullies pick there victims each day in pe so all u guys on the affirmative team are WRONG!"
207,arg39274,1,1,2,1,"while yes phys. ed. classes should still be in high schools they shouldnt be mandatory(especially not all 4 years of HS). maybe just having PE be an optional class and having one year be a mandatory thing instead of a continuous PE class. in lower grades, yes it should be mandatory because little kids are more likely to gain and lose weight in weird patterns. That Is All."
208,arg271353,2,2,3,2,OK no and yes I think p.e should be education which is teaching students how to eat right and live a healthy life style not making a fat kid run 10 laps around a track but showing them that eating right and exercise can BE FUN not having an obese child being bully because they can't run as fast as someone else. That is what physical education could be real EDUCATION. Students should not feel bad if they can't run a 5k or do 20 push ups
209,arg203471,1,1,2,1,Gym class is a useless class that students waste time in. There should be a test and if people can not run a mile without stopping every couple feet they should join. There is also the fact people can join to get prepared for sports. Students should have that class time to use it towards their careers and not a class that is just there.
210,arg245105,1,1,2,1,"i'm not pleased with the idea to increase P.E. requirement. First, i thinks that it is not up to the college to require students to exercise. i believes that students have the responsible to choose whether or not to work out. Also, i says that there shouldn't be any P.E. requirement in the college. According to me, the college is a place to train our brain not our body. i adds that if students do need exercise, they can exercise on their own as me. i goes hiking and plays basketball in my neighborhood."
211,arg202607,1,1,1,1,Besides just a few people apply physical exercises in their life's!
212,arg110967,2,2,2,1,"phy. ed is just another class. students should start to be responsible for their actions by the time they are in highschool. if they are responsible with a car, then they should be responsible with their health. the tax payers also dont realize that they are paying for students to go swimming or play the whole hour."
213,arg561672,2,2,3,2,"1. It makes everyone equal - if children can wear what they want some children will teased and feel less equal to their peers around them vs. uniforms

Okay Look school is for learning not how you look and dress but maybe in some levels it matters and most people that go to schools that don't have uniforms take like about 1 hr just to find their pants or shirt I mean really?? When you have a uniform it takes less than 10 min just to take it out and put it on and"
214,arg198376,2,2,3,2,"That's really good idea. As i remember every morning i though what was better to wear? It was really problem, i spent quiet a lot of time. I asked my parents to buy new clothes for me, it was happened not rare. I know that not everyone thought as me, but it much better if the school has own uniform and everybody has to follow it. First it looks very good, smart. Secondly there is no envy that somebody have really nice skirt or jeans. Every pupil is the same and it would be easy to study, to not think about another things!!"
215,arg234411,2,2,3,2,"In a school all the students may not belong to the same financial status . Some may be rich , some may not be that rich . So uniform provides equal status to all the students so that there is no gap among them . If there is no uniform , then the rich students will wear new dresses everyday which the other students cannot afford and may lead to resentment among them .

Some insensitive children may also mock other students wear old cloths .

So I beleive that uniform is essential especially in developing countries ."
216,arg200133,2,1,2,1,"school uniform does no harm to students life emotions now as for the point of expressing oneself imagine one bully wearing shirt,tie,pant all neatly ironed and well polished shoes wont he look good.remember dressing sense also is a part of ur interveiw"
217,arg203869,2,2,3,2,"I think it's good within certain limits. I went to a school with a uniform, and it was far less stressful than non-uniform college. I'd argue that it's a leveler- prevents people from showing off material wealth/ making others feel bad for not having 'cool' stuff.

But it can be taken too far. By the end, we weren't allowed coloured socks, which was idiotic."
218,arg198417,2,2,3,2,"According to the legacy educational resources, as fashion and trends change, students become more concerned with how they look and how they are perceived than they do with their academic success and achievement. The fashion of low rise jeans, bagging jeans, large trench coats, low cut shirts, and many others contribute to behavior problems and safety issues in the classrooms and in the hallways of schools today."
219,arg203922,2,2,2,2,"yes, i believe it's nice to have a school uniform. Each school 's uniform signifies its goal for instant i wore white shirt and blue skirt in my school days, white color is an indication of peace and blue of fidelity in relationships moreover identical uniform also removes the wall of status. it also depicts that whether a child comes from high or low class they all are treated equally under one roof ."
220,arg660921,1,1,2,1,"yas,of course . School uniform is important

1.school uniform is a logos for our school

2.to remind us that we are part of the school

3.and if we use the uniform basically student used to think what are they gonna do to, is it positive or negative

4.in the morning we should use our uniform and if were not use our uniform the teacher give us a punishment and from that we can learn to be a discipline student

5.if we go out from the school than the teacher will see we used the school uniform so people will know that we from that school

thankyou"
221,arg212151,1,1,1,1,"If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class.

Maybe I'm exaggerating.

But my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause."
222,arg542561,2,2,2,2,"THE SCHOOL UNIFORM IS A VERY GOOOOOOOOOD IDEA , WHY ??

becouse the school uniform makes pupils concentrated on their education than on their clothes and I believe that school uniform instills discipline among pupils it makes pupils with diferent material statuses more equal :)"
223,arg231770,1,1,2,1,i thik thier bad because i think ushould be free with out nobody telling u wat to do
224,arg238471,3,3,3,3,"I take the view that, school uniform is very comfortable. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Every teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days."
225,arg198954,3,2,3,1,"I truly believe that wearing uniform is bad, because it is not helping to student to express his/her individuality. It is also very uncomfortable , and during winter time might very cold as well. That is why schools shouldn't force students to wear uniform."
226,arg336277,2,1,2,1,the kids lose their individuality and it doesn't feel comfortable
227,arg238468,2,2,3,2,"I have always maintained that it is a good idea to wear a uniform to school. Why not? because it looks very nice and respectful. This shows the status of schools and students. I always liked to wear a uniform at my school, I felt like a schoolgirl, and brought up."
228,arg251309,3,3,3,2,"The school my mother works at, plus the school district my cousin's 3 children are in, are utilizing school uniforms. One reason is to ""reduce bullying"", which in reality, doesn't even address the problem concerning bullying. The only good it does is that it gets rid of or reduces students being bullied because they aren't wearing a specific clothing label that they dictate is the IN thing to wear. While it's a problem, all it does is sweep the one basic type of bullying under the rug. Kids will find other reasons to bully others. It also infringes upon their basic rights to be individuals and to express their individuality."
229,arg200706,2,2,2,2,"We talk about how schools destroy creativity and uniforms are a classic example of that destruction. In most schools with uniforms the students are given the occasional day to were their casual clothes but are then given strict guidelines as to what is acceptable. This is effectively turning ""casual clothes"" into a twisted ""causal"" uniform."
230,arg238473,2,2,3,2,Another reason for wearing a school uniform is good is that the uniform will always be decent. It will cover every part of the body that the school doesnt want the children to show and the students would not be cauntious about what they are wearing.
231,arg199549,3,3,3,2,"Another reason argued against school uniforms is that they deprive the children of their individuality. The stress on a uniform dress code in school opposes the spirit of unity in diversity and its celebration. It is even claimed to restrict socialization, a vital aspect of human nature."
232,arg199159,2,2,3,2,"I want to mention about wearing school uniform by high school students. it really makes no sense, it's the opposite, it just makes troubles within students and teachers relations. People aged 16-18 do not like any limits and sometimes limiting their freedom can become very serious problem followed by misunderstandings with the rest of people like parents and teachers. What about the controlling person's behavior - it must be done in the childhood, but not in the age when students become adults."
233,arg35584,3,2,3,2,"It's better to have a father than to not have one. For example, me. I grew up without a father and if I had a choice of being a billionaire or to have a father growing up, I'd choose to have a father. I'm basically a bastard legally because he isn't even on my birth certificate. No one should grow up without a father because honestly, it messes with them. Kids in school will ask about your dad and you have nothing to say. Whether he is lousy or not, a child should always be in touch with their dad. Even if he isn't with the mother anymore."
234,arg35726,2,2,3,2,"It would be better to have a lousy father than to not a have a father at all. If you were to grow up with out a father you would always have that empty void feeling about it. And if your father is lousy it helps you strive to be better than him. It could also cause you to start being responsible faster because the father isn't taking care of business. Like me and my brother, my father is lousy but I'm still happy i know who he is. Just because i cant imagine wondering about it."
235,arg35650,2,2,3,2,"I think that it will be better to have an lousy father than no father. A least you have an father. You know who he is and where he is. You will also kinda get an idea on what you going to be when you go up. If he is an lousy father, that will help you not be what he is. You can say that it is motivation that will help you became an better father. Because you don't want to be like your father. You want to better that your father, in-fact that should motivate you to be the greatest father you can be."
236,arg35698,2,2,3,2,"Its better to have a lousy father then not have one at all. Even if you have a lousy father you can still learn from him. You can tell yourself, ""I'm not going to be like him, I'm going to be better"". Even if you have a lousy father his going to love you no matter what."
237,arg35700,2,2,2,2,I would have to choose a lousy father. I think having a father figure around even though he might not do much for you or the family is better than none. A father to me plays a huge role in a childs life he keeps thing stable throughout your childhood. My father is pretty lousy but he does support me and helps out sometimes I would rather have a father than none.
238,arg35676,2,2,3,2,"I wouldn't live my life right if I never got to meet my father. I wouldn't care if I grew up and had lousy father even if he has no job or life and maybe even an alcohlic. Having a father means alot especially if your boy because most fathers are friends to, so you can talk to them about guy problems and they would understand the situation and with just living with your mother you couldn't because she's a woman and her views are different then a guy. Whether its a good or lousy father they will always be there for you at sometime in life."
239,arg35635,2,2,2,2,"I believe it is better to have a lousy father than to have none. It is important to have a role model to look up to and without that figure, you might become lost in the world. A lousy father is not that bad because what exactly makes a lousy father, always working and not having time for you. A father that isn't always around is no reason to prefer to have no father. Growing up and seeing the way your father is, makes you want to become like him or gives you the motivation to surpass him and become even better than he is."
240,arg35615,2,2,3,2,Even though your father might not be the best or always there for you he is still your father. Every father has a certain connection with there children and thats what shapes and molds a son or daughters character and personality. I believe our parents play a major role in determining who we are even if they are lousy they are still our kin.
241,arg35619,3,2,3,2,"There is scientific evidence that shows having a mother and a father is the healthiest way for a child to progress physically and mentally.

So a lousy father is better than none.(that is of course assuming that he is not abusive in any way)

Also, people change. Who says that he will be lousy forever. There are family therapy sessions you can attend to help."
242,arg35720,1,1,2,1,"I think is better to have a lousy Father than to be Fatherless, maybe having one is not that bad, other than living with the idea you didn't had one or with the doubt of how could it be to have one."
243,arg35718,2,2,3,2,"Honestly, I'd rather be completely fatherless, not saying that not having is better than having one, albeit a lousy one. However, I do believe that you can grow up completely fatherless and without any major male role model and still be successful. Take myself for example; I lived the first thirteen years of my life without a father or any fatherly interaction, and those were the essential times a kid needed to be around his/her father, I turned out great(Self-opinion). So yes, as opposed to having a lousy father that would rub off on me and mold me into half a man, I would much rather being fatherless."
244,arg35758,3,2,3,2,"I would rather be ""fatherless"" then having a ""lousy father"", because a ""father"" is supposed to be the man of the house and set a good example so the rest of the family can look up to him. So if I look up at a lousy father I might then be a lousy person, but if I had no father then I'll set the standards for my own self and step up and be the man of the house especially if I had younger brothers or sisters."
245,arg35705,2,2,3,2,I think in any case its better to have no father then to have a lousy father either way you still lose. When you have a father you want him to be the best he can be so you can learn from him as you grow up. If you were to have a lousy father then whats the point of having a father at all if he's just going to be lousy and he wouldn't teach you anything. It's always better to have a respectable father figure in your life then to have a lousy father figure.
246,arg35622,3,2,3,2,"I think it would be better fatherless the reason why is because i have never had a father in my life. I think that if you have a lousy father you will be taught to be lousy just like him. Parents are supposed to be setting examples for their kids, not just be lazy and that type of thing. Whats the point of having a bum for a father your whole life? you are not going to learn anything from him so why keep him? I feel like a mother can raise a son the same as a father can, well at least my mother did."
247,arg35748,3,2,3,2,"Having a lousy father does not just leaves bumps, scrapes and scars externally. The damage goes much deeper. During those vital years of childhood having a bad dad isn't something that one forgets easily. Not only does it alter self confidence and self worth, it can covertly brand those bad habits in the mind of the child. The characteristics of an unfit parent are poisonous. I believe that it is better to be fatherless, rather than have a lousy father. Yes, it will take much effort to fill the shoes of the missing party, but it can and should be done."
248,arg35591,3,2,3,2,"In my opinion, I believe it is better to be fatherless then to have a lousy father. I wouldnt know how it feel to have a lousy father but I have friends that there fathers are always drunk and never do anything to help them. They sometimes tell me they wish there dad wasn't around. Now if my dad was like that I would think the same because at least by not having a father you wouldnt know how it feels to be dissapointed by a father."
249,arg35669,2,1,3,1,"Well, this is not an easy question to answer because both are kind of the same to me. But i would have to say fatherless because i'd rather have no man in my life than have somebody that isn't concerned about your life at all. To me that kind of is like being fatherless. I can always find another father figure or not even as much as a father figure, more like a male role model."
250,arg35706,3,3,3,2,It really sucks not having a man to look up to while your growing up. I believe that being fatherless is better then having a lousy father. The reason I believe this is the best is because you dont want to be looking up to a guy that does nothing in life and its just setting bad examples. Who knows you might grow up following his steps. So being fatherless is better because from day one you start depending on your own with no need of a father being there. And theres always going to be other people by your side helping you get through life.
251,arg35632,2,2,2,2,"It's better to be fatherless. Having a lousy father creates a bigger gap in your life than being fatherless. It is a proven fact that if you're a girl, you'll look for someone to be your other half that's similar to your father. Having a lousy father, for a girl, would mean having a lousy boyfriend as well. By having no father you don't have to worry about how terrible they are and all you have to do is ponder how amazing your dad could have been. Wondering what could have been is better than wondering how much better it could be."

On the other hand, a lousy father would be with you in your thoughts forever."

259,arg439197,2,2,3,1,I'm sad to see the way this turned out. With not so little respect and so much spamming. I choose atheism over a Christianity because their is not enough evidence to soothe my curiosity. Christianity raises too many questions that it never answers.

Its teachings, written by an all powerful, all knowing, creator of the universe, are filled with contradictions.

Firstly because it is not one belief that every Christian shares, it lacks solidarity. I compare it to a road with all different kinds of sideways. Ask a question about religion, and lots of people will find one of those sideways to adjust their religion to their personal beliefs.

With Athe��sm, the concept is pretty clear. It is more scientific, and I like that."

that means they have a disorder"

porn is definitely wrong. after a dosage, the guilt of wasting ur time, wasting energy, wasting effort and not devoting urself to another thing and regretting that you should not have started would almost kill you. trust me.

its a road that shld not be taken, its as bad as smoking and dugs. i think the only reason its not banned in most developed countries is that they are facing an aging population."

275,29278,2,2,2,2,"Porn is definitely wrong. Porn is like an addiction to some people which is unhealthy and can lead to guilt and lust. An addiction to porn gives an unhealthy image of real sex.

If a man and a woman or a woman and a woman or man and a man are in a relationship then they should not need any other forms of sexual gratification other than their spouse. Out of love. And respect."

Likewise, if, as a society we were to berate movie actors (for example), then the act of being an actor would become degrading.
